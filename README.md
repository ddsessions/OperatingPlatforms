### *Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?*

&ensp;&ensp; The Gaming Room was a new client to our consulting company, and they wanted to develop a web-based game that served multiple platforms. The client had an existing game, Draw It or Lose It, that was only available in an Android app.

&ensp;&ensp; Draw It or Lose It renders images from a library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds each lasting one minute. Drawings are rendered at a rapid rate and are fully complete after thirty seconds. If the team doesn't guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a fifteen-second time limit. 

&ensp;&ensp; Software Requirements:
* A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
* Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
* Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
* Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

### *What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?*

&ensp;&ensp; I was able to clearly break down an executive summary, design contraints, and domain model as well as research development requirements for the server side, client side, and development tools based on different operating systems. Finally, the research allowed me to state my recommendations for the software design.

### *What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?*

&ensp;&ensp; The design document helped streamline the coding process and confirm expectations of the software to plan an efficient workflow.

---

### *If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?*

&ensp;&ensp; I would choose to revise my domain model explanation and include more details about how object-oriented programming is used in the development of the game.

### *How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?*

&ensp;&ensp; The entire development process revolves around the user's needs. You have to understand how they will use the software and identify inputs and outputs. You must know their requirements then translate them into a software design that meets those requirements by outlining design constraints.

---

### *How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?*

&ensp;&ensp; Evaluating the development requirements really helped to plan the best path for delivering a functional application that would meet the client's needs. I was able to identify which operating system would be most cost-effective and developer-friendly, which architecture offered necessary services, and which development tools would be the most versatile for the project.
